	<div  class="phones-1 tablet-1 computer-1"><div class="heading" id="c1">Sugarcane juice</div>
		<div>Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane. It is consumed as a beverage in many places, especially where sugarcane is commercially grown, such as Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, North Africa, and Latin America. Sugarcane juice is obtained by crushing peeled sugar cane in a mill and is one of the main precursors of rum.

In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing, "evaporated cane juice" is considered by FDA to be a misleading term for "sugar" on product labels because the FDA regards "juice" as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables; the preferred term is "cane sugar".

			Jal-jeera, or jaljira, is an Indian beverage. It is flavored with a spice mix known as jal-jeera powder. In Hindi, "jal" means water and "jeera" means cumin. The beverage form is essentially lemonade and jaljira powder, and is a popular summer drink in India. It is sometimes served as an appetizer, as it is intended to "startle" the taste buds.

Jaljira powder generally consists of cumin, ginger, black pepper, mint, black salt, some fruit powder, and chili or hot pepper powder.
Jaljeera is popular in northern India because it is thought to have cooling properties, against the temperature of the region.It is generally served with appetizers before a meal, but is also drunk between meals. Some versions do not involve any added sugar.
